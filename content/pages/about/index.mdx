Hi!

Kumar Abhijeet - currently working at Gojek, building engineering platforms focused on enhancing developer productivity. He is an aspiring polyglot who loves building and exploring systems to either add or understand value. He enjoys working with infrastructure, using Chef and Terraform by desire and the most suitable langauge for any project he's building, but he has a soft spot for Python and Ruby.


Abhijeet is his free time, play video games and electric guitar. Metal and RnB are his favorites genres, he is always down for a song recommendation.
