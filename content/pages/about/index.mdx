Abhijeet is a polyglot(I guess) and Infra nerd who loves building and exploring complex(or simple) software and tech infrastructure systems.

He is curious and looking for like-minded folks in the field of Infrastructure Automation, Observability and Platforms and currently dabbling into Distributed Systems Internals.

As night dwells, Abhijeet transforms into a [singer-songwriter/music producer](https://linktr.ee/ahemcholic) working on his debut EP.

He also takes up film scoring projects for films/games/commercials.
