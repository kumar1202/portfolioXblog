Hey all,

I wrote this blog titled "How We Use Sidekiq to Process Background Jobs" for the Gojek blog during my internship. So just made an entry for that blog here too.

Read it here -> [How We Use Sidekiq to Process Background Jobs](https://blog.gojek.io/how-we-use-sidekiq-to-process-background-jobs/).
